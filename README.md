**What's the result of my work for this app?** <BR />
I created a back end e-commerce app that allows you sort by various way such as products, tags, categories, etc. You can add new products,
update them, or delete them. This is good for managing inventory in a small store or small business.

**What did I learn from this assignment?** <BR />
I learned a lot in the backend. Getting mysql and sequelize to work wasn't an easy task. I went through the various lessons and figured out
what to do. Tutoring also helped me learn a lot about SQL.
